  <!-- Prerequisites -->
  <section class="cd-section pb-sm-2 mb-5" id="prerequisites">
    <h2 class="h3 pb-1 pb-sm-0 mb-sm-4">Prerequisites</h2>
    <ul class="gap-3">
      <li><span class="text-body-emphasis fw-semibold">HTML / CSS / JS (required):</span> These core web technologies are essential for using the template.</li>
      <li><span class="text-body-emphasis fw-semibold">Bootstrap 5 (required):</span> This framework is necessary for the template's design and functionality.</li>
      <li><span class="text-body-emphasis fw-semibold">Sass / Scss (highly recommended):</span> Utilizing SCSS variables for customizing the template is much easier than modifying plain CSS code directly. It allows for more streamlined style adjustments.</li>
      <li><span class="text-body-emphasis fw-semibold">Npm (highly recommended):</span> npm is a powerful package manager tailored for Node.js, enabling efficient management of project dependencies. This tool helps with installing, updating, and removing dependencies. Additionally, npm includes a feature called "npm scripts," which automates common tasks such as minification, compilation, unit testing, linting, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-0"><span class="text-body-emphasis fw-semibold">Note:</span> All necessary configuration files, such as <span class="text-body-emphasis fw-medium">package.json</span>, are provided in the download package.
